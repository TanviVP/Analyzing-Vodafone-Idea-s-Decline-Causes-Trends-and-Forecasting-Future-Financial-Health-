Further, Depreciation & Amortisation expenses and Net Finance costs for the quarter were Rs. 53.7

The total debt from banks and financial institutions stood at Rs. 46.5 billion and Optionally Convertible 
Debentures at Rs. 1.6 billion as of June 30, 2024. The debt from banks and financial institutions reduced 
by Rs. 45.5 billion during the last one year (was at Rs. 92 billion in Q1FY24). The cash and bank balance

The payment obligations to the Government stood at Rs. 2,095.2 billion as of June 30, 2024 including 
deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs. 1,392 billion and AGR liability of Rs. 703.2 billion.  
Operational highlights 
Post the fund raise, we are working towards high impact and quickly executable priorities. As a result, 
we have increased our data capacity by ~7% till date and expect to grow the data capacity by ~15% and 
4G population coverage by ~16mn by end Sep’24. We have expanded Voice over WiFi in our priority 
circles and at select locations in other circles.  
We have completely shut down 3G sites in 7 circles with Haryana getting added to the list of 6 other 
circles; namely Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Mumbai and Kolkata. We are in the 
process of shutting down 3G across other circles as well. Our overall broadband site count stood at 
~417,250 as of June 30, 2024 and during the quarter we added ~6,600 4G sites.  
We have deployed ~74,750 TDD sites, ~13,950 Massive MIMO sites and ~13,250 small cells till date. 
Further, we continue to expand our LTE 900 presence in 14 circles at multiple locations, to improve 
customer experience and with the recent additional 900 MHz spectrum acquisition we will be able to 
expand our LTE 900 MHz in 16 out of 17 priority circles.  Our current 4G network covers over 1 billion 
Indians (4G coverage is the population reached/covered by VIL with its 4G network).

The 4G subscriber base continued to grow for the twelfth successive quarter. The 4G subscriber base 
stood at 126.7 million at the end of Q1FY25 vs 122.9 million in Q1FY24, an addition of 3.8 million 4G 
subscribers over last one year. The total subscriber base stood at 210.1 million. ARPU improved to Rs. 
146, up 4.5% on YoY basis vs Rs. 139 in Q1FY24, primarily aided by change in entry level plan and 
subscriber upgrades.  
The recent price interventions are in line with our commitment to provide the consumers with simple 
and comprehensive plans. We curated an optimum range of feature rich plans to meet the diverse needs 
of our consumers. Also, staying true to our philosophy of supporting entry level users and progressively 
linking higher prices to higher usage, changes in entry level plans are nominal. We are offering a range 
of unmatched benefits to pre-paid customer by offering ‘Night Free Data’ and ‘Weekend Data Roll Over’ 
with our ‘Hero Unlimited’ plans and a unique ‘Choose Your Benefit’ option to our post-paid customers 
under ‘Vi Max’ plans. We also launched Vi Guarantee program in the prepaid segment, a unique offer 
that provides 130GB of data to all 5G and new 4G handset customers. Unlike some of the market offers 
that cater only to 5G customers, this plan also benefits new 4G handset users. 
During the cricket world cup, we introduced the second leg of ‘Be Someone’s We’ campaign focusing on 
the stories of empty nesters battling loneliness and the role of Vi in bridging that often unattended gap. 
It made an appeal to everyone to make the world less lonely with the power of connectivity and 
deepened emotional affinity to build positive momentum and consumer connect for Vi.  
In March 2024, we entered the connected TV space with the launch of Vi Movies and TV in a brand new 
avatar, offering a single app to access 17 OTT platforms and over 300 live TV channels. This makes high-
quality digital entertainment accessible to every household.  
International Roaming has been a focus area for us with packs offering 'Truly unlimited data and calls'. 
We are the only telecom operator in the country to offer truly unlimited benefits in 29 countries on 
international roaming. Over the last one year we have expanded international roaming footprint from 
98 to 120 countries. 
On the World MSME Day, Vi Business launched 'MSME Growth Insights Study 2.0', India’s largest digital 
maturity assessment study. Developed in collaboration with Dun & Bradstreet, this comprehensive study 
spans 16 industries and provides insights into MSME ecosystem in India, Government policies, sector-
specific trends, and the future of digitalization. Based on the study, Vi Business launched the Ready for 
Next digital assessment tool 3.0 to support businesses in accelerating their digital transformation 
journey, ensuring they are 'Future Ready' and able to establish safe and secure workplaces for their 
employees.

During the quarter, the Company has been lauded with several awards. Vi won the prestigious Cannes 
Lion award along with Spikes Asia, The One show, D&AD & Kyoorius Awards for its Human Network 
testing Network campaign. At The MOMMYs 2024 awards, Vi won 'Best Social Media Brand- Telecom'. 
At AFAQs Marketers 'Xcellence Awards 2024, Vi won 5 awards - 2 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze for its ‘Be 
Someone’s We’, Postpaid, performance marketing & Human Network testing Network campaigns. Vi 
Business was global winner of prestigious ICMG Global Award 2023 for Best Digital Strategy Execution 
& Best Customer Centricity & Excellence. 
Spectrum Auction 
We acquired 50 MHz of spectrum across low band and mid band spectrum (900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 
2500 MHz) in 11 circles for a total commitment of Rs. 35.1 billion. In addition to renewal of 900 MHz 
spectrum in UP West and West Bengal circles, we also enhanced our 900MHz spectrum holding in 7 
circles, namely Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan, UP East and Kolkata. This 
enables us to dedicate adequate 900 MHz band spectrum for 4G thereby enhancing the experience of 
our 4G customers in these large markets. In the 4 circles of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and 
Punjab our customers will be able to experience 4G on L900 for the first time. We also added 1800 MHz 
spectrum in Madhya Pradesh and 2500 MHz spectrum in Bihar, which will help us in increasing the 
network capacity quickly. 
We hold highest 4G spectrum per million subs amongst the 3 private operators and competitive 5G 
spectrum in our 17 priority circles, which will allow us to offer superior experience to customers as well 
as to effectively utilize the spectrum across existing and emerging technologies. 
Equity Issuances  
During this calendar year, we raised equity funding of ~Rs. 240 billion including Rs. 180 billion via FPO in 
April’24, ~Rs. 20.8 billion via preferential issuance to ABG (promoter) entity in May’24, ~Rs. 24.6 billion 
via preferential issuance to Nokia and Ericsson in July’24 and Rs. 16 billion via conversion of OCDs 
between March’24 to July’24. This equity fund raise bolsters our capex rollout for building a top quality 
4G & 5G network to contribute towards India’s digital transformation. Post these issuances, the 
Promoters shareholding stands at 37.2% and shareholding of Government of India stands at 23.1%.
