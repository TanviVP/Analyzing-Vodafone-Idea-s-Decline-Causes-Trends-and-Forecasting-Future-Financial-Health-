 Management Discussion and Analysis
Financial highlights 
Revenue for the quarter was Rs. 109.3 billion, a QoQ improvement of 4%. The customer revenue 
increased by 5.6% vs last quarter aided by the recent tariff hikes undertaken by all private operators. On 
a reported basis, EBITDA for the quarter was Rs. 45.5 billion. Cash EBITDA excluding Ind AS 116 impact 
improved to Rs. 23.2 billion, highest since merger, growing by 10.5% QoQ.  
Further, Depreciation & Amortisation expenses and Net Finance costs for the quarter were Rs. 54 billion 
and Rs. 63.1 billion respectively. Excluding the impact of Ind AS116, the Depreciation & Amortisation 
expenses and Net Finance costs for the quarter were Rs. 39.4 billion and Rs. 54.1 billion respectively. 
Capex spend for Q2FY25 was Rs. 13.6 billion vs Rs. 7.6 billion in Q1FY25. The expected capex for H2FY25 
is Rs. 80 billion. 
The debt from banks and financial institutions reduced by Rs. 45.8 billion during the last one year (was 
at Rs. 78.3 billion in Q2FY24) and stood at Rs. 32.5 billion. The cash and bank balance was Rs. 136.2 
billion as of September 30, 2024. 
The payment obligations to the Government stood at Rs. 2,122.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 
including deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs. 1,419.4 billion and AGR liability of Rs. 703.2 
billion.  
Operational highlights 
Immediately post the fund raise, we executed quick and impactful capex resulting in an increase of our 
4G data capacity by ~14% and 4G population coverage by ~22 million reaching to 1.05 billion at the end 
of Sep’24 vs 1.03 billion in Mar’24.  
During the quarter, we added ~42,000 4G sites, the largest ever addition in 4G sites in a quarter by the 
Company. We did significant network enhancement by deploying 4G on sub GHz 900 band across 
~20,500 sites, including site expansion on recently acquired 900 MHz spectrum in some circles, offering 
superior indoor network experience as also increased coverage. We also added ~21,200 sites in the 1800 
MHz and 2100 MHz bands mainly to increase the network capacity resulting in customers experiencing 
faster data speed on Vi GIGAnet network. We shut down ~19,700 3G sites and our overall broadband 
site count stood at ~439,600 as of September 30, 2024. Due to rapid shutting down of 3G sites across 
circles, 3G sites are present only in 8 circles as of September 30, 2024.

Quarterly Report Sep’24

We have deployed ~74,750 TDD sites, ~13,950 Massive MIMO sites and ~13,250 small cells till date. 
Further, we expanded our LTE 900 presence to 16 circles out of 17 priority circles.  
Post the conclusion of the mega deal with the three global equipment manufacturers in September, 
2024, the delivery and deployment started in October, 2024. The 4G expansion is in progress and our 
target is to achieve 4G population coverage of 1.1 billion by March 2025 and 1.2 billion by September 
2025. The rollout of 5G in key geographies will start in Q4FY25.  
The subscriber base, including 4G subscriber, was impacted by the recent tariff hikes. The 4G subscriber 
base stood at 125.9 million at the end of Q2FY25 vs 126.7 million as of Q1FY25. However, in the postpaid 
segment, we have been able to increase our customer base on QoQ as well as YoY basis. While a larger 
part of this increase is from M2M segment, we have seen consistent increase in retail postpaid 
customers over last one year, as we are providing optimum range of feature rich offerings to meet the 
diverse needs of postpaid customers. 
We refreshed RED X Plan in postpaid at a monthly rental of Rs. 1,201 offering unlimited data for non-
stop surfing, streaming, and connectivity in addition to complimentary offers like subscription to Netflix, 
Amazon Prime, Disney+Hostar, Sony Liv Premium, Sun NXT, EaseMyTrip benefits, airport lounge access, 
7-day International Roaming pack, 3-month membership of SwiggyOne along with Priority customer 
service across all Vi touchpoints.  
We are also witnessing good traction on ‘Vi Movies & TV’. We have 18 OTT partners onboard including 
the likes of Disney+ Hotstar, SonyLiv, Zee5, SunNxt and a host of regional OTTs. We have our TV app for 
all TV OS including Google TV, Kaizen for Samsung TVs and Firestick. We have recently bundled Vi Movies 
& TV with some of our premium prepaid Unlimited packs and Vi Max Postpaid plans.  
Customer ARPU (ex M2M) improved to Rs. 166 vs Rs. 154 in Q1FY25, up 7.8% on QoQ basis, driven by 
tariff hike.  
In the recently concluded Indian Mobile Congress (IMC) 2024, our show themed 'Future is Live' 
highlighted how we are transforming the way businesses and people live, work, and connect with 
advanced technologies. We showcased Industry 4.0 solutions by integrating 5G, IoT, AI, and ML to 
connect human and non-human assets, digitise processes, and enable real-time monitoring. This was 
demonstrated through a fabricated Smart Mine with multiple use cases depicting real-time monitoring 
of worksites, rapid response during emergencies, smart wearables and safety management. We also 
exhibited ‘Ready for Next’ initiative for MSMEs, along with AI powered hybrid SD-WAN, CPaaS and CCaaS 
solutions. We also showcased our comprehensive mobile gaming platform – Vi Games through first ever 
grassroots eSports tournament ‘Vi Game to Fame’. We had also set up a state-of-the-art 360-degree

connected over Vi’s low latency, high speed network, and creating music in complete sync, showing how 
connectivity can enable the creators and the artists virtual ecosystem.
