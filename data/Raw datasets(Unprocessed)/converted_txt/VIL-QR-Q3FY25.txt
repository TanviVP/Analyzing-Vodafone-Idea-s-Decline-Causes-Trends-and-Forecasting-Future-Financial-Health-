 Management Discussion and Analysis
Financial highlights 
Revenue for the quarter was Rs. 111.2 billion, a QoQ growth of 1.7%. The customer revenue increased 
by 1.6% vs previous quarter aided by the recent tariff hikes undertaken by all private operators. On a 
reported basis, EBITDA for the quarter was Rs. 47.1 billion. Cash EBITDA excluding Ind AS 116 impact 
improved to Rs. 24.5 billion, highest since merger, growing by 5.4% QoQ.  
Further, Depreciation & Amortisation expenses and Net Finance costs for the quarter were Rs. 56.3 
billion and Rs. 56.9 billion respectively. Excluding the impact of Ind AS116, the Depreciation & 
Amortisation expenses and Net Finance costs for the quarter were Rs. 41.6 billion and Rs. 47.5 billion 
respectively. 
Capex spend for Q3FY25 was Rs. 32.1 billion, taking the capex for the nine months to Rs. 53.3 billion. 
The network rollout will accelerate further in Q4FY25 with the full year expected capex of ~Rs. 100 
billion. 
The debt from banks reduced by Rs. 52.9 billion during the last one year and stood at Rs. 23.3 billion 
(was at Rs. 76.2 billion in Q3FY24). The cash and bank balance stood at Rs. 120.9 billion as of December 
31, 2024. 
Operational highlights 
We rapidly expanded our 4G coverage and capacity during this year. In the last nine months, we 
increased our 4G population coverage by ~41 million, reaching 1.07 billion by the end of Dec'24 
compared to 1.03 billion in Mar'24. During the same period, our 4G data capacity expanded by ~24%, 
driving ~28% improvement in 4G speeds. We are on track to achieve our 4G population coverage target 
of 1.1 billion by March 2025 and plan to further increase it to 1.2 billion i.e. ~90% of population. The 
commercial launch of 5G services in Mumbai is planned for March 2025 and Delhi, Bangalore, 
Chandigarh and Patna for April 2025. 
During the quarter, we expanded our footprint to more than 4,000 unique broadband towers, the largest 
addition in a quarter by the Company since merger. We continued network enhancement by deploying 
4G on sub GHz 900 band across ~15,000 sites, offering increased coverage as well as superior indoor 
network experience. We also added ~10,400 sites in the 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz bands primarily to 
increase the network capacity resulting in customers experiencing faster data speed on Vi GIGAnet 
network. Our overall broadband site count stood at ~460,300 as of December 31, 2024 including ~75,800

TDD sites, ~13,950 Massive MIMO sites and ~12,800 small cells. Further, we expanded our LTE 900 
presence to 16 circles out of 17 priority circles.  
On the back of the extensive network expansion and upgrade, we rolled out one of India’s most 
hyperlocal campaigns to make consumers aware about the marked improvement in the experience with 
our network. We amplified local stories of how it is ‘Our best ever network’ at a city/district/locality level 
to reiterate the extent and impact of network expansion. 
In line with our commitment to drive differentiated propositions that meet ever evolving consumer 
needs, we launched two new offerings this quarter. The Super Hero Offering, launched in our 12 key 
markets, provides Unlimited Data for 12 hours from 12 midnight to 12 noon in addition to the 2GB daily 
quota. The Non-Stop Hero Offering, launched in remaining 10 markets, provides Unlimited Data for full 
24 hours. As data consumption continues to grow, especially for consumers without wired broadband 
access, these propositions enable a worry-free data experience.  
Our diverse and feature-rich postpaid offerings have set us apart, enabling us to effectively cater to the 
evolving needs of our customers. We launched Easy+, a new innovative proposition for corporate post-
paid subscribers, offering them an option to select and directly purchase additional services like 
International roaming, OTT subscriptions and data packs for their personal needs on their existing 
corporate plans. This service can be availed by downloading the Vi App. This first-of-its-kind proposition 
introduces a simplified approach by making it seamless for subscribers to purchase services of their 
choice on their corporate post-paid plans, thus offering complete flexibility and enhancing the overall 
customer experience. We have achieved consistent growth in our postpaid customer base on both a 
quarterly and yearly basis. While a significant portion of this increase comes from the M2M segment, 
we have also seen a steady rise in retail postpaid customers over the past year, reflecting the strong 
appeal of our tailored plans and services.  
The 4G subscriber base stood at 126 million at the end of Q3FY25, increasing from 125.6 million as of 
Q3FY24. Customer ARPU (ex M2M) improved to Rs. 173 vs Rs. 166 in Q2FY25, up 4.7% on QoQ basis, 
driven by tariff hike and customer upgrades.   
During the quarter, we partnered with Lionsgate Play, a premium streaming service, for Vi Movies & TV 
App and bundling of Vi Movies & TV with our flagship postpaid plans, to offer higher value to our 
consumers. Additionally, we have also introduced ‘First Episode Free’ feature for all original content on 
Zee5, enabling subscribers to make an informed decision before subscribing. Vi Movies & TV now offers 
subscribers access to more than 17 OTTs including Zee5, Disney+ Hotstar, SonyLiv, Lionsgate, Fancode, 
SunNxt, Chaupal, Nammaflix, Playflix and many more, and over 350 Live TV channels.

Vi Business continues to receive accolades. During the quarter, its ‘Ready for Next’ Campaign for MSMEs 
was awarded the bronze category by ET Brand Equity Digi Plus. Additionally, the Vi Business Assist 
platform was recognized as ‘Best New Product Launch’ at the 5th Silver Feather Awards.  
Government Reform on Bank Guarantee (BG) Waiver  
In December 2024, the Department of Telecommunication (DoT), extended its support to the telecom 
industry by dispensing with the requirement of Bank Guarantee to be submitted for spectrum auctions 
held prior to the Telecom Reform package 2021 with certain conditions. Prior to this reform, BGs 
aggregating to ~Rs. 247.5 billion were to be provided. As per the communication received from DoT, no 
BGs are required to be provided for the auctions until 2021, except a one-time requirement to provide 
BG for partial shortfall for the 2015 auction for a period of one year.  
It is important to note that this BG waiver confirms government’s continued support to the telecom 
sector. This reform will also ensure that the exposure of the banking system is utilized by telecom 
operators towards further proliferation of 4G and 5G networks in India.  
 
Preferential allotment 
On January 9, 2025, we completed the allotment of ~1.7 billion equity shares of face value of Rs. 10/- 
each at an issue price of Rs. 11.28 per share (including premium of Rs. 1.28 per share) for an aggregate 
consideration of Rs. 19.1 billion to Vodafone Group (Promoter) entities on a preferential basis. As a 
result of this preferential allotment, the aggregate shareholding of the Promoter Group in VIL has 
increased from 37.3% to 38.8%. During last 10 months, Vi raised equity of ~Rs. 260 billion including Rs. 
180 billion from the largest FPO in India, Promoters infusion of ~Rs. 40 billion and conversion/equity 
issuance to key vendors of ~Rs. 40 billion.
