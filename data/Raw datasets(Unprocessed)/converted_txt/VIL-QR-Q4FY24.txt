included herein.

cannot be assured. Although we believe that industry data used in this report is reliable, it has not been 
independently verified. 
Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements due to risks or 
uncertainties associated with our expectations with respect to, but not limited to, our ability to successfully 
implement our strategy, our growth and expansion, technological changes, our exposure to market risks, general 
economic and political conditions in India which have an impact on our business activities or investments, the

 Management Discussion and Analysis
Financial highlights 
Revenue for the quarter stood at Rs. 106.1 billion, a YoY improvement of 0.7% aided by improving 
subscriber mix, 4G subscriber additions and change in entry level plan. On a reported basis, EBITDA for 
the quarter grew by 3.0% on YoY basis from Rs. 42.1 billion in Q4FY23 to Rs. 43.4 billion and EBITDA 
margin for the quarter was 40.9%. EBITDA pre-IndAS116 grew by 5.4% on YoY basis to Rs. 21.8 billion 
compared to Rs. 20.7 billion in Q4FY23. This is highest quarterly EBITDA post-merger. 
Further, Depreciation & Amortisation expenses and Finance costs (Net) for the quarter are Rs. 57.5 billion 
and Rs. 62.5 billion respectively. Excluding the impact of Ind AS 116, the Depreciation & Amortisation 
expenses and Finance costs (Net) for the quarter stands at Rs. 42.6 billion and Rs. 53.5 billion respectively.  
The annual revenue and EBITDA (pre-IndAS 116) grew consecutively for second year despite significantly 
lower investments; clearly reflecting our execution capabilities. Revenue for the year grew by 1.1% from 
Rs. 421.8 billion to Rs. 426.5 billion as a result, EBITDA for the year increased from Rs. 83 billion to Rs. 
84 billion registering a growth of 1.3%.  
Capex spend for the quarter stood at Rs. 5.5 billion, and capex for the year at Rs. 18.5 billion. 
The total debt from banks and financial institutions stood at Rs. 40.4 billion and Optionally Convertible 
Debentures at Rs. 1.6 billion as of March 31, 2024. The debt from banks and financial institutions 
reduced by Rs. 70.9 billion during the last one year (was at Rs. 111.3 billion in Q4FY23). The cash and 
bank balance stood at Rs. 1.7 billion as of March 31, 2024.  
The payment obligations to the Government stood at Rs. 2,034.3 billion as of March 31, 2024 including 
deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs. 1,331.1 billion and AGR liability of Rs. 703.2 billion.  
Operational highlights 
In line with our stated strategy, our investments are focused towards our 17 priority circles to expand 
our high-speed broadband network coverage and capacity by rolling out new 4G sites on the existing 
locations, upgrading our core and transmission network as well as by refarming 2G/3G spectrum to 4G, 
as these 17 circles accounts for ~98% of our revenues.   
Our overall broadband site count stood at ~ 430,700 as of March 31, 2024 and during the quarter we 
added ~917 4G sites. We have shut down 3G completely in 6 circles with Kerala getting added to the list 
of 5 other circles; namely Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Mumbai and Kolkata where 3G 
spectrum is completely refarmed to 4G. Till date, we have deployed ~74,850 TDD sites in addition to the

deployment of ~13,950 Massive MIMO sites and ~13,300 small cells. Further, we continue to expand 
our LTE 900 presence in 14 circles at multiple locations, including through dynamic spectrum refarming, 
to improve customer experience. Our 4G network covers over 1 billion Indians (4G coverage is the 
population reached/covered by VIL with its 4G network). We have completed minimum rollout 
obligations for 5G in 4 circles of Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab.  
The 4G subscriber base continued to grow for the eleventh successive quarter. The 4G subscriber base 
stood at 126.3 million at the end of Q4FY24 vs 122.6 million in Q4FY23, an addition of 3.7 million 4G 
subscribers over last one year. The overall subscriber base stood at 212.6 million. ARPU improved to Rs. 
146, up 7.6% on YoY basis vs Rs. 135 in Q4FY23, primarily aided by change in entry level plan and 
subscriber upgrades. The total data traffic for the quarter witnessed a YoY growth of 4.3%.  
During the quarter, we continued our brand campaign - ‘Be Someone’s We’, rooted in the company’s 
vision of being a partner to its customers; in building a better today and a brighter tomorrow. Further, 
in our endeavor to offer unprecedented benefits, we continued the 'Choose Your Benefit' on Vi Max 
postpaid with the introduction of Swiggy One as one of the benefits. During IPL, we engaged with our 
customers on social media through the Vi 20 FANfest program.   
Vi Movies & TV was relaunched in a new avatar as a one stop destination for entertainment - an all in 
one app with 13+ OTTs & 400 Live TV channels. Vi App offering has been expanded beyond seamless 
utility bill payments to now enabling e-commerce via Vi Shops. We have recently introduced mobile 
cloud gaming service called Cloud Play, in partnership with CareGame.  
During the quarter, Vi Business has been lauded with seven CIO Choice recognitions for IoT, Cloud 
Telephony, SD-WAN, Rich Business Messaging, Telecom Carrier (Mobile Access), Telecom Carrier 
(International Access) services on the basis of an extensive pan-India CIO referral voting process that 
spans across industry verticals. We have also been honoured as the Digital Transformation Enabler for 
its ReadyForNext Assessment for MSMEs. Adding more stars to its glory, Vi Business has been awarded 
the Asian Telecom Awards 2024 for end-to-end multimodal logistic solution – Vi Business Sanchaar 
Shakti under the category IoT Initiative of the Year – India. Our Vi Business IoT Smart Central Platform 
too bagged a victory at the Voice & Data Excellence Awards 2023. 
Fund Raise and Capex Plans 
Equity Fund Raise 
Further Public Issue - We raised Rs. 180 billion through the largest FPO in India. The success of our FPO 
is testimony to the confidence and trust that has been reposed in us by  investors as the issue was 
subscribed ~7 times.

Conversion of OCD by ATC into equity shares - We had issued Optionally Convertible Debentures (OCDs) 
amounting to Rs. 16 billion to ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (ATC) in February 2023. In 
March 2024 ATC requested for conversion of OCDs amounting to Rs. 14.4 billion into equity shares. The 
conversion price was Rs.10, which was determined at the time of OCD issuance and was at a premium 
to the then prevailing market price.  
Preferential Allotment - On May 8, 2024, the shareholders approved equity infusion of Rs. 20.75 billion 
on preferential basis, from an Aditya Birla Group (ABG) entity, at an issue price of Rs. 14.87 per share. 
This coupled with the preferential equity raise of ~Rs. 49.4 billion in 2022 from Vodafone Group and ABG 
takes the total fund infusion by both the promoter groups to ~Rs. 70 billion between March 2022 and 
May 2024.  
Post the FPO, Preferential Allotment and conversion by ATC, the Promoter shareholding stands at 
~38.2% and GoI shareholding at ~23.8%. 
Debt Fund Raise  
We are in discussions with consortium of banks to raise upto Rs. 250 billion and additional non-fund 
based facilities of upto Rs. 100 billion. Post the Telecom reforms package in September 2021, our bank 
exposure has reduced by ~Rs. 346 billion. 
Capex Plans  
The above Equity funding, debt funding including non-fund based facilities are to be utilised primarily 
towards capex which is expected to be in range of Rs. 500 to 550 billion over next 3 years. The capex will 
be towards expanding 4G population coverage in 17 priority circles, 5G launch in key cities / geographies 
and capacity expansion to address the increasing data demand. We will continue to work towards 
enhancing our services to offer seamless and world-class digital experience to our consumers.
