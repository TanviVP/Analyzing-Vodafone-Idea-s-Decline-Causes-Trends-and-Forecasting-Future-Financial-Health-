cannot be assured. Although we believe that industry data used in this report is reliable, it has not been 
independently verified. 
Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements due to risks or 
uncertainties associated with our expectations with respect to, but not limited to, our ability to successfully 
implement our strategy, our growth and expansion, technological changes, our exposure to market risks, general

Our 5G services are now available in Mumbai, Delhi, Chandigarh and Patna. We plan to expand the same 
to key cities in 17 circles, where we hold 5G spectrum, by August 2025.  
During the quarter, we expanded our footprint by more than 6,900 unique 4G towers, the largest

GHz 900 band across all the 16 circles (out of 17 priority circles) where we have 900 MHz spectrum and 
during the quarter, we added ~18,400 sites, enhancing overall coverage and significantly improving 
indoor connectivity. Further, we added ~14,500 sites in the 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz bands primarily to 
boost network capacity, enabling faster data speeds on the Vi GIGAnet network. Our overall broadband

We remain committed to delivering more than just seamless connectivity—our focus is on enriching 
consumers’ digital lifestyle with experiences that extend well beyond just voice and data. For postpaid 
users, we recently launched the Vi Max Limitless Postpaid Data Plans across 9 markets, offering truly 
unlimited high-speed data. With our post-paid plans, consumers can enjoy a suite of premium benefits 
including exclusive entertainment access and value-added services. We also recently launched enhanced 
International Roaming packs that now offer double data, free Incoming calls, and more. Further, we 
have partnered with Blue Ribbon Bags, a US-based lost baggage concierge service, to offer baggage 
protection for our postpaid international roaming customers.  These enhancements aim to address key 
travel concerns and provide a comprehensive and worry-free international travel experience for Vi 
customers.

offers Unlimited Data from midnight to noon plus 2GB/day, while the Non-Stop Hero Plan (in 16 markets) 
provides Unlimited Data 24x7.These plans generated strong traction in the prepaid segment, driving 
growth in both ARPU and subscribers across key markets. 
The 4G subscriber base stood at 126.4 million at the end of Q4FY25. Customer ARPU (ex M2M) improved 
to Rs. 175 vs Rs. 153 in Q4FY24, up 14.2% on YoY basis, driven by tariff hike and customer upgrades.   
We expanded our retail presence by opening over 100 new flagship stores over the past six months to 
focus on customer experience. This expansion brings the total number of Vi flagship stores to over 500 
nationwide, all directly operated by the company in metro and Tier 1 markets. Additionally, our overall 
physical retail footprint now includes more than 2,500 Vi and Mini stores across 600 cities and towns. 
While a large share of our customer concerns is resolved digitally through Vi App, we still serve over 
50,000 customers daily across retail touchpoints. Our stores enable us to deliver a distinct and high-
quality service experience, as reflected in a strong Google rating of 4.4 out of 5.
