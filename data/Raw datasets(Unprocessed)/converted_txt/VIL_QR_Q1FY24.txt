included herein.

cannot be assured. Although we believe that industry data used in this report is reliable, it has not been 
independently verified. 
Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements due to risks or 
uncertainties associated with our expectations with respect to, but not limited to, our ability to successfully 
implement our strategy, our growth and expansion, technological changes, our exposure to market risks, general 
economic and political conditions in India which have an impact on our business activities or investments, the 
monetary and interest policies of India, inflation, deflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, foreign

 Management Discussion and Analysis
Financial highlights 
Revenue for the quarter stood at Rs. 106.6 billion, a QoQ improvement of 1.2% aided by better subscriber 
mix and 4G subscriber additions. On a reported basis, EBITDA for the quarter stood at Rs. 41.6 billion and 
EBITDA margins were at 39%. EBITDA excluding IndAS116 impact was at Rs. 20.2 billion compared to Rs. 20.7 
billion in Q4FY23, primarily due to higher network expenses and customer acquisition cost partially offset by 
the reduction in roaming and access charges.  
Further, Depreciation & Amortisation expenses and Finance costs (Net) for the quarter are Rs. 56.2 billion 
and Rs. 63.8 billion respectively. Excluding the impact of Ind AS 116, the Depreciation & Amortisation 
expenses and Finance costs (Net) for the quarter stands at Rs. 41.7 billion and Rs. 54.6 billion.  
Capex spend for the quarter stood at Rs. 4.5 billion. 
The total gross debt (excluding lease liabilities and including interest accrued but not due) as of June 30, 2023 
stood at Rs. 2,117.6 billion comprising of deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs. 1,337.4 billion and 
AGR liability of Rs. 668.6 billion that are due to the Government, debt from banks and financial institutions 
of Rs. 95 billion and Optionally Convertible Debentures amounting to Rs. 16.6 billion. With cash & cash 
equivalents of Rs. 2.5 billion, the net debt stood at Rs. 2,115.1 billion. The debt from banks and financial 
institution has reduced by Rs. 57 billion during the last one year (Rs. 152 billion in Q1FY23). 
Operational highlights 
We continue to follow focused approach to investments, biased towards our 17 priority circles and are 
expanding our high speed broadband network coverage and capacity by rolling out new sites, upgrading our 
core and transmission network as well as by refarming 2G/3G spectrum to 4G. Our overall broadband site 
count stood at around 442,100 as of June 30, 2023 and during the quarter we added around 1,000 4G sites. 
Till date, we have deployed ~74,800 TDD sites in addition to the deployment of ~13,800 Massive MIMO sites 
and ~13,100 small cells. Further, we continue to expand our LTE 900 presence in 14 circles at multiple 
locations, including through dynamic spectrum refarming, to improve customer experience. Our 4G network 
covers over 1 billion Indians (4G coverage is the population reached/covered by VIL with its 4G network).  
We are in discussion with various network vendors for finalisation of our 5G rollout strategy. We have 
completed device testing of all major OEMs on our 5G network. We also have the highest rated voice quality 
in the country as per TRAI’s ’MyCall’ App data for 28 out of 32 months between November 2020 and June 
2023. Our relentless pursuit to offer better experience to our customers is clearly visible through these 
network investment initiatives.

The 4G subscriber base continued to grow for the eighth consecutive quarter and stood at 122.9 as on June 
30, 2023 vs 122.6 million in Q4FY23. However, the overall subscriber base declined to 221.4 million vs 225.9 
million in Q4FY23. ARPU improved to Rs. 139, up 2.9% QoQ vs Rs. 135 in Q4FY23 primarily aided by migration 
of subscribers to higher ARPU plans. We continue to see high data usage per broadband customer at ~15.7 
GB/month with the total data traffic for the quarter witnessing QoQ growth of 3.5%. A unique night data 
pack ‘Chhota Hero’ was launched to allow customers to snack on content during the night with unlimited 
data. 
We continue to make progress on the marketing front by communicating key differentiators to consumers, 
entering into alliances and introducing various innovative products and services. With the holiday season, Vi 
promoted its International Roaming packs with 'Truly unlimited data and calls' on Digital. Vi is the only 
telecom operator in the country to offer truly unlimited data and call benefits on international roaming. With 
these initiatives, at The MOMMYs 2023 awards, Vi won 'Best Social Media Brand- Telecom' and 'Best use of 
memes'. At AFAQs Marketers 'Xcellence Awards 2023, Vi won 5 awards - 1 gold, 1 silver and 3 bronze for Best 
use of influencer marketing, Best use of Instagram, Best use of short form video, Best performance marketing 
and Best use of influencer on YouTube. 
In line with our digital offering strategy, we continue to add to our array of content offerings, digital products 
and services through partnerships on Vi App. We have recently launched ‘Vi One’ a converged proposition to 
the consumers offering fiber, mobility and over-the-top (OTT) under a single plan. This has been launched in 
3 circles currently, in partnership with You Broadband and will be expanded to other circles in partnership 
with other ISPs. 
Vi Business continues its endeavour to partner businesses in the digital era. To address the growing need for 
reliable and secure networking solutions, Vi Business has launched Hybrid SD-Wan, an enhanced proposition 
designed in collaboration with global tech leaders. Vi Hybrid SD-WAN helps businesses simplify and optimize 
their network infrastructure and enhance their security posture, while ensuring cost efficiency. On World 
MSME Day, Vi Business having conducted India’s largest MSME assessment covering nearly 1 Lakh 
respondents across 16 Industries, published ‘Unlocking MSME Growth Insights Report’ containing findings on 
the digital readiness of MSMEs. We further launched a 360 degree ’ReadyForNext2.0’ program to focus on 
growth from this segment covering the learnings from the above report, upgraded Digital Self Evaluation tool 
to help MSMEs harness technology and exclusive MSME offers.
