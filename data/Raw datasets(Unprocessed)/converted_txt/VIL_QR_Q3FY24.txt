cannot be assured. Although we believe that industry data used in this report is reliable, it has not been 
independently verified. 
Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements due to risks or 
uncertainties associated with our expectations with respect to, but not limited to, our ability to successfully

Vi is building a competitive advantage by increasing customer engagement and heralding a new 
Digital Ecosystem with the introduction of Movies & TV, Music, Videos, Games, Jobs & Education 
services.  
During the quarter, we launched our new brand campaign - ‘Be Someone’s We’, rooted in the 
company’s vision of being a partner to its customers; in building a better today and a brighter 
tomorrow. This is relevant in today’s world as several studies indicate that people from all walks of 
life, especially the GenZ & millennials are struggling with challenges such as loneliness and social 
isolation; impacting their overall well-being. The campaign focused on deepening emotional affinity 
to build positive momentum and consumer connect for Vi. This campaign was promoted across TV, 
digital & on ground. To exhibit being someone’s we, various on-ground engagements were carried 
with NGOs, old age homes etc. to celebrate the brand’s promise with people who feel lonely.  The 
employees, along with more than 500 kids from NGOs created a Guinness World Record for largest 
notebook sentence, with 23K+ notebooks across 1lakh sq.ft to generate awareness of ‘Be 
Someone’s We’. These notebooks were then distributed amongst the children, bringing a smile on 
their faces. 
Further, in our endeavor to offer unprecedented benefits, we introduced 'Choose Your Benefit' on 
Vi Max postpaid—a pioneering feature allowing customers to customize plans based on their 
needs. This marked the end of an era for postpaid plans that were one-size-fits-all. The launch was 
supported by a comprehensive 360-degree campaign, encompassing outdoor, print, and 
commercials aired throughout the World Cup. During the festive season, Vi HERO Unlimited

 Management Discussion and Analysis
Financial highlights 
Revenue for the quarter stood at Rs. 106.7 billion, a YoY improvement of 0.5% aided by improving 
subscriber mix, 4G subscriber additions and change in entry level plan. On a reported basis, EBITDA for 
the quarter grew by 4.1% on YoY basis from Rs. 41.8 billion in Q3FY23 to Rs. 43.5 billion and EBITDA 
margin for the quarter was 40.8%. EBITDA excluding IndAS116 impact grew by 6.8% on YoY basis to Rs. 
21.4 billion compared to Rs. 20 billion in Q3FY23. This is highest pre-IndAS116 EBITDA in last 11 quarters. 
Further, Depreciation & Amortisation expenses and Finance costs (Net) for the quarter are Rs. 56 billion and 
Rs. 64.9 billion respectively. Excluding the impact of Ind AS 116, the Depreciation & Amortisation expenses 
and Finance costs (Net) for the quarter stands at Rs. 41.2 billion and Rs. 55.8 billion respectively.  
Capex spend for the quarter stood at Rs. 3.3 billion, and capex for the nine months at Rs. 13 billion. 
The total gross debt (excluding lease liabilities and including interest accrued but not due) as of 
December 31, 2023 stood at Rs. 2,149.6 billion comprising of deferred spectrum payment obligations of 
Rs. 1,382.4 billion and AGR liability of Rs. 690.2 billion that are due to the Government, debt from banks 
and financial institutions of Rs. 60.5 billion and Optionally Convertible Debentures amounting to Rs. 16.6 
billion. The net debt stood at Rs. 2,146.4 billion. The debt from banks and financial institution reduced 
by Rs. 71.4 billion during the last one year (was at Rs. 131.9 billion in Q3FY23). 
Operational highlights 
Our capital investments are focused towards our 17 priority circles to expand our high speed broadband 
network coverage and capacity by rolling out new 4G sites on the existing locations, upgrading our core 
and transmission network as well as by refarming 2G/3G spectrum to 4G. Our overall broadband site 
count stood at ~ 438,900 as of December 31, 2023 and during the quarter we added ~ 1,400 4G sites. 
We have shut down 3G completely across 5 circles of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Mumbai 
and Kolkata by refarming the spectrum in these circles. Till date, we have deployed ~74,800 TDD sites in 
addition to the deployment of ~13,900 Massive MIMO sites and ~13,000 small cells. Further, we 
continue to expand our LTE 900 presence in 14 circles at multiple locations, including through dynamic 
spectrum refarming, to improve customer experience. Our 4G network covers over 1 billion Indians (4G 
coverage is the population reached/covered by VIL with its 4G network). We are in discussion with 
various technology partners for finalisation of our 5G rollout strategy as well as working with many 
partners to develop 5G use cases relevant to the Indian market and build device ecosystems. We are 
also in advance stage of 5G trials of embracing new technologies such as vRAN & ORAN.

The 4G subscriber base continued to grow for the tenth successive quarter and stood at 125.6 million as 
on December 31, 2023 vs 121.6 million in Q3FY23, an addition of 4.1 million 4G subscribers. The overall 
subscriber base stood at 215.2 million. ARPU improved to Rs. 145, up 7.4% on YoY basis vs Rs. 135 in 
Q3FY23, primarily aided by change in entry level plan and subscriber upgrades. The total data traffic for 
the quarter witnessed a YoY growth of 4.2%.  
During the quarter, we launched our new brand campaign - ‘Be Someone’s We’, rooted in the company’s 
vision of being a partner to its customers; in building a better today and a brighter tomorrow. This is 
relevant in today’s world as several studies indicate that people from all walks of life, especially the GenZ 
& millennials are struggling with challenges such as loneliness and social isolation; impacting their overall 
well-being. The campaign focused on deepening emotional affinity to build positive momentum and 
consumer connect for Vi and was promoted across TV, digital as well as various on-ground engagements 
with NGOs, old age homes etc. to celebrate the brand’s promise with people who are experiencing 
loneliness.   
We recently integrated ‘utility bill payment’ functionality on Vi app enabling our users to pay their 
electricity bills, water bills, LPG bills, recharge FASTAG & their DTH or broadband subscriptions or pay 
insurance premium / Loan EMIs. Further, leveraging telco data and access capabilities to create a Digital 
marketplace, we have launched ‘shop’ section on Vi App in partnership with leading players across 
categories like entertainment, food, shopping and travel. 
In this fast-evolving digital era, enterprise needs have broadened for various services. We are the only 
provider of ‘Rich Business Messaging’ service and have successfully delivered 2 billion messages during 
this year. It is a new visually appealing medium for enterprises to reach their customers and has distinct 
feature benefits. They can do one-on-one communication in a segmented way where the brand name, 
company logo is visible over SMS and contains rich content like images, pdf, gifs, videos etc. The digital 
user experience interface allows for many experience features like URL embedding, location sharing, 
carousal scrolling of content along with capabilities of chatbot and real time analytics.  
Further, Vi Business has been honored with Frost and Sullivan Best Practices Award 2023 wherein our 
Smart Mobility solutions have received the 2023 Enabling Technology Leadership Award and our Session 
Initiation Protocol (SIP) Trunking services have received the 2023 Technology Innovation Leadership 
Award for the second time in a row.
